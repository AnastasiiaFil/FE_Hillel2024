                Selectors - patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. <br> It is possible to divide CSS
                selectors into five categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On this page you can find the explanation of some CSS selectors from each category.

            <div class="accordion">
                <button class="accordion-btn">Simple selectors</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h3>The CSS element Selector</h3>
                    <p class="with-divider">
                        The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. The element selector was
                        applied to the &lt;h1&gt; element on this page, centering its text content and setting a
                        specific text color.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The CSS id Selector</h3>
                    <p>
                        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
                        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique
                        element. The id selector was applied to the &lt;h2&gt; element, centering its text content,
                        adding a bottom border, and providing
                        some padding at the bottom.
                    </p>
                    <!-- /* CSS multiple class Selector */ -->
                    <p class="with-divider note-box">
                        Note: An id name cannot start with a number.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The CSS class Selector</h3>
                    <p>
                        The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. The class selector was
                        applied to the &lt;button&gt; element (".accordion-btn"), and it styles the accordion buttons by
                        setting the background color, text color, cursor, padding, and text alignment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="with-divider note-box">
                        Note: A class name cannot start with a number.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The CSS multiple class Selector</h3>
                    <p>
                        The class selector selects HTML elements with a combination of a specific class attributes. The
                        multiple class selector was applied to some &lt;p&gt; elements ("with-divider note-box"). The
                        combination of these
                        two classes ( .with-divider .note-box), applies styles that create a &lt;p&gt; element with a
                        divider line between
                        neighboring elements and a bordered box around the content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="with-divider note-box">
                        Note: A class name cannot start with a number.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The CSS Universal Selector</h3>
                    <p>
                        The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. The universal selector sets
                        the font-family property to "Arial, sans-serif" for all elements in the HTML document.
                    </p>
                    <p class="with-divider note-box">
                        Note: May be ineffective and may slow down the page rendering process, especially on pages with
                        many elements.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion-btn">Combinator selectors</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.</p>

                    <h3>The CSS Descendant Selector</h3>
                    <p class="with-divider">
                        The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element. The
                        Descendant Selector on this page selects all &lt;h3&gt; elements that are descendants (located
                        inside) of elements
                        with the class .accordion-content and assigns them a specific color.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Child selector (&gt;)</h3>
                    <p class="with-divider">
                        The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element. Child
                        selector (&gt;): Setting padding for each element of &lt;ul&gt;, that is a direct descendant of
                        the element with the
                        class .accordion-content
                    </p>

                    <h3>Adjacent sibling selector (+)</h3>
                    <p class="with-divider">
                        The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another
                        specific element.
                        Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately
                        following". Adjacent sibling selector (+): Set margin-bottom for each list item (li) inside the
                        &lt;ul&gt; element, which is a
                        descendant of the element with the class .accordion-content
                    </p>

                    <h3>General sibling selector (~)</h3>
                    <p class="with-divider">
                        The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
                        General sibling selector (~): Apply style to each &lt;ul&gt; list element that immediately
                        follows a &lt;p&gt; element.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion-btn">Pseudo-class selectors</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, it can be used to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Style an element when a user mouses over it</li>
                        <li>Style visited and unvisited links differently</li>
                        <li>Style an element when it gets focus</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The pseudo-class selector applies styles to elements with the class .accordion-btn when the mouse
                        cursor is hovering
                        over them (:hover pseudo-class). Thus, when a user hovers the cursor over the accordion button,
                        the button's background
                        changes to the specific color. In this case, the :hover pseudo-class allows for styling changes
                        to the element upon
                        interaction with it. The syntax of pseudo-classes:</p>

                        <code>
                            selector:pseudo-class {
                                property: value;
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. For example, it can be used
                        to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Style the first letter, or line, of an element</li>
                        <li>Insert content before, or after, the content of an element</li>
                    </ul>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            selector::pseudo-element {
